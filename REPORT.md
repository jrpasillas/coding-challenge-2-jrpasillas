### CODING CHALLENGE #2: REPORT

 For coding challenge #2, I included seven 'if' statements and one 'else' statement. The first 'if' statement was used to first and foremost compare the Systolic and Diastolic pressure from the patient's input and decipher whether it would continue to run through the rest of the code or be printed as an Error. The next statement used was an 'else' statement to compare all the other 'if' statements that would follow depending on if the numbers passed or didn't pass. The second 'if' statement is used to identify if the blood pressure is considered normal by identifying and contrasting both the Systolic and Diastolic pressure numbers (using the 'and' scenario). The third 'if' statement is similar to how the blood pressure is measured except this is to determine if there is an elevated blood pressure (also using the 'and' scenario). The fourth 'if' statement determines if the numbers inputted mean Stage 1 Hypertension by running the Systolic and Diastolic pressure numbers, this time through an "or" instead of an "and" scenario. The fifth 'if' statement works the same way as the previous statement except this statement identifies if the numbers mean Stage 2 Hypertension. As for the last two 'if' statements (six & seven), they work together in a sense that they use the 'and/or' scenario to identify and label the numbers as Hypertensive Crysis if they pass through this specific statement.
  Looking back on my code, I feel like I could have shrunken the 'if' statements to four or less 'if' statements if I knew how to execute the challenge. Before I ended up with seven 'if' statements, I previously had around 14 'if' statements but tweaked and played around with the code and shrunk it down to 7 'if' statements. Yet, I feel like I could shrink it even more by combining statements that possibly don't need seperating into other 'if' statements and going from there. For example, to use one 'if' statement and simply list the possible numbers with relational opperators (as shown in the code) and treat them like switch statements if possible. The switch statements would allow me to have multiple cases and which in this code would allow me to label each case as Normal, Elevated, Stage 1 Hypertension, Stage 2 Hypertension, and so forth. Above all, this code was beneficial to me in a way that it challenged me to think outside the box when inputting 'if' statements and I learned a thing or two about blood pressure levels.
